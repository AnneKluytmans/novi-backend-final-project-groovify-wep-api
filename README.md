## About The Project

**Groovify** is an innovative web API designed to support vinyl stores in efficiently managing their daily operations.
The API is built to optimize workflows for both customers and store employees. It enables customers to browse
collections, place orders and view their order details and invoices, while empowering staff to handle inventory and
process orders with ease.

### Features
- **Product Management**: Customers can browse the vinyl collection with filters and sorting options like artist, genre, or price. 
Staff can add, update, or remove vinyl records, manage stock levels, and upload/download vinyl record covers to keep the catalog 
accurate and up-to-date.
- **Order Management**: Customers can place orders easily and view their order details along with corresponding invoices. 
Staff can view, process orders, and generate or modify invoices to ensure smooth transactions and accurate records.
- **Customer Account Management**: Customers can create and manage their accounts to view their personal data, orders and invoices.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure access ensures that users can only perform actions within their permissions, 
keeping sensitive information protected.
